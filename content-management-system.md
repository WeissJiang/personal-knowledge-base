### Content Delivery API

A Content Delivery API is a specific type of API designed to allow developers and applications to retrieve content from a Content Management System (CMS). This kind of API is particularly designed for use in "headless" or "decoupled" CMS architectures, where the CMS is used solely for storing and managing content, while the presentation and delivery of content are handled by other systems or front-end frameworks.

In a headless architecture, the Content Delivery API plays a crucial role as it provides a standardized way to request and receive content. This enables front-end developers to use any technology or framework of their choice to build the user interface while relying on the structured content provided by the CMS through the API.
